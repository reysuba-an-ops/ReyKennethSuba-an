# Rey Kenneth R. Suba-an — Portfolio (Template)

This is a simple, responsive, and interactive portfolio template you can customize.

## Files
- `index.html` — main page
- `styles.css` — styling
- `script.js` — interactivity (filters, modal, skill animations)
- `README.md` — this file

## How to customize
1. Open `index.html` and replace:
   - Your name and tagline in the header.
   - About text and contact email.
   - Project cards: replace images, titles, descriptions, and links.
   - Skill labels and `data-level` percentages (0–100) in the skills section.
2. Replace placeholder images (currently using placeholder.com) with your screenshots.
3. Update social links and resume link in the Contact section.

## Deploy (GitHub Pages)
1. Create a new GitHub repository (e.g. `rey-portfolio`).
2. Add these files, commit, and push to the `main` branch.
3. In repo settings → Pages, choose branch `main` and folder `/ (root)`, then save.
4. After a minute, your site will be live at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Notes & ideas
- Replace the mailto form with a real backend or use a form provider (Formspree, Netlify Forms).
- Add project categories, badges, or links to GitHub repos and live demos.
- Consider adding images and an "About" photo.
- If you want a PDF resume, link it from the Contact section.

If you want, I can:
- Customize the template with your actual projects and links now — just send the project details (title, short description, category, image URL, demo/repo link).
- Generate a ready-to-publish GitHub repository structure and instructions for deployment.
